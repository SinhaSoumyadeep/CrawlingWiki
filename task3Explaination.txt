************************************ Task 3 Explaination ****************************
The focused keyword is "green" and the Seed url is "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint"
however it can also take in a set of focused words which can be used to filter the urls encountered while crawling.
The url is split into individual words based on regular expression that checks for non alpha numeric character and "_".
the text of the anchor tag is also taken into consideration which is split into words using space and then the entire word set is checked with the regular expression which looks for the focused word or similar word. the regular expressing checks for the word boundary and also checks if the matched word is preceded by non numneric characters. which will make sure that words that are similar are not matched. For example: if the focused word is "Rain" where as the url received during a crawl contains "Brain" then it should not match. Thus only those words that are similar but have similar meaning will be considered as vaild. Once its a match it is then checked in the pyenchant dictionary to make sure that the word matched makes sense. If these requirements are fulfilled then the url is added to the list.
